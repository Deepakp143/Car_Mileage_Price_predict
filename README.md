# Used Car Price Prediction and Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the prices of used cars from various brands. 
The primary objective is to determine if a car's mileage is a reliable predictor of its sale price and to explore 
how this relationship varies among different car brands. Additionally, we aim to identify other factors that influence 
the price that potential buyers are willing to pay.

## Project Overview

- **Problem Statement:** A used car dealership is seeking insights into the factors affecting used car prices to optimize their pricing strategy and enhance profitability.
- They want to understand whether the mileage of a car plays a significant role in determining its sale price and if this relationship differs across different car brands.

## Project Tasks

1. **Collect and Preprocess the Data:** Collect data on the mileage and sale prices of used cars. Preprocess the data by cleaning it, handling missing values, and transforming it as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Our EDA phase aims to uncover patterns and relationships between mileage and sale prices for each car brand. We'll visualize data and conduct statistical analysis to gain insights.

3. **Split the Data:** We'll divide our dataset into training and testing sets, enabling us to build and evaluate our regression model effectively.

4. **Choose a Regression Model:** Based on the characteristics of our data, we'll choose an appropriate regression model, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, or multiple regression.

5. **Evaluate the Regression Model:** We'll assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), or root mean squared error (RMSE).

6. **Interpret the Coefficients:** This step involves interpreting the model coefficients to determine if mileage is a reliable predictor of sale prices for various car brands and if the relationships differ among brands.

7. **Make Predictions:** Once the model is trained and validated, we'll use it to predict car sale prices based on their mileage.

8. **Provide Recommendations:** Lastly, we'll offer recommendations to the used car dealership on how to price their cars effectively to achieve their business goals.
